### R4 Radiology Trainees Lecture Python Code

This repository holds the source code and accessory material & links for the Singapore R4 Radiology Trainees Python lectures.

There will be links to any additional software required, as well as install instructions where this is not obvious.

Most code is within Jupyter notebooks (`.ipynb` files) although some are only included as .py files and should be run from the
command line or from the IDE/environment of your choice, the most well known being VSCode and PyCharm.

VSCode: https://code.visualstudio.com/

PyCharm: https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/

### Basic Requirements

You will require Python version 3.6 or higher.

The code is specifically designed to be as platform-agnostic as possible, and should run on PC, MacOs and Linux without too much fuss.

### Notes

Each subfolder contains a mini-project that has been created specifically for the R4 lectures
